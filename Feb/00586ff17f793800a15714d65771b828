By Andile Mngxitama As we enter the days of celebrating the birthday of Major 1 I hope all leaders, more so us in the revolutionary space, can observe and learn from the relationship between Prophet Uebert Angel and Prophet Bushiri. Even if you are not a Christian or believer, I ask you to be open-minded and observe a mutually reinforcing and empowering leadership. It’s the most inspiring education in leadership you will ever see. We are inspired and we learn from the men of God. Hokma wisdom…. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
