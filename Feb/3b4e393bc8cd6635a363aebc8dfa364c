By Andile Mngxitama In SA a bundle of food for living is R4000 a month. The minimum wage is generally around R3500. Members of Parliament earn R90 000 a month and Cabinet Ministers earn over R200 000 a month. BLF says give the unemployed (including unemployed graduates) a R5000 monthly allowance or a job and people say we are mad. If a government can’t ensure that its people are employed then it must feed them. There are people who think it’s a bad thing to demand R5000 as a basic income grant for all. Thing is BLF teaches us not to adjust to injustice in a world that makes it normal, so we appear to be mad and irrational. We have overdosed on Biko syrup. We are able to see in a nation of the blind. It’s a heavy burden. It’s our duty to bring all to the light of God. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
