By Andile Mngxitama Let’s think together … Cabinet Ministers earn R200 000 (excluding perks) a month, but they give the poor R350 a month during the Covid-19 lockdown. How is this legal and ethical? What do they say when they give the poor who vote for them the R350? Or is the price of bread, milk and rent different for the poor? How do we accept this as normal? Time to think big and black! We gotta change this. What’s good for the Ministers is good for us too! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
