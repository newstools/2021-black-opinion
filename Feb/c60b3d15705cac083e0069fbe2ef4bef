By Andile Mngxitama Guys, myself I love Major 1. That’s all thank you! I think he really is an amazing Prophet and super gifted over all leaders. I find his sermons intellectually fulfilling. Have you heard the classic teaching on anticipation of danger and evading it? Look how he puts into practice his teachings. I’m still awestruck by how he left the entire SA government dizzy. That’s revolutionary leadership! This prophet threatens Stellenbosch straight up. It feels good to be a son of Major 1. Shalom… We respect all other prophets and denominations.
