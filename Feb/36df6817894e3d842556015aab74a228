By Andile Mngxitama “I don’t lead terrorists. I lead Africans who want their self-government and land. God did not intend that one nation be ruled by another for ever.” – Dedan Kimathi Yesterday marked the 64th year since the execution of the revolutionary Dedan Kimathi by the British colonialists. Kimathi, who left a teaching job and took to the mountains and started a guerrilla war for land and freedom, was only 36 when he was murdered by the British. He led the heroic Mau Mau in the war to cleanse Kenya of the bloodsuckers who stole the land. The British colonialists feared Kimathi so much that for over 50 years no one in Kenya knew where his grave was. The Mau Mau were hunted, raped, castrated and more, but their will to fight never ended. Kimathi, contrary to what the West says about nationalist movements, fought side by side with African women who occupied some of the highest ranks in the Mau Mau army. Sadly Jomo Kenyatta who benefitted the most from the Mau Mau sacrifices, refused to recognize their struggles at the independence of Kenya. Daniel arap Moi, who took over from Kenyatta also did the same. The Mau Mau remained banned in independent Kenya for over 40 years. It was only Mwai Kibaki in the late 2000s who recognised and unbanned the great Mau Mau. I was privileged in 2007, thanks to the support of Brother Explo Nani-Kofi and the progressive network he led that I was able to meet the widow of Kimathi, Elosi Mukami, and one of their daughters in Nairobi. We met with other Mau Mau warriors who still brandish their signature dreadlocks that terrified the settlers. We were told of how the government had abandoned the Mau Mau warriors, most of whom were dumped in the marauding slums of Kenya like Kibera. What struck me the most was how religious the Mau Mau warriors were. We started the meeting with a Christian prayer and ended with some gospel singing and prayer. I left Kenya with a heavy heart on how we have forgotten those who suffered so much so that we may know freedom. Black First Land First (BLF) has honored the Mau Mau and vowed to continue the war of Dedan Kimathi. The basic document of BLF is called the Black Agenda. It starts with this Mau Mau poem: “There is no success without a struggle
What are you waiting for?
Where are you when the struggle for land is on,
What are you waiting for?
Have you not yet joined,…
What are you waiting for?
Even if you think you are rich,
What are you waiting for?
Land is truly our national wealth,
What are you waiting for?
What sort of man are you,
what sort of woman are you,
What are you waiting for?
Or are you one with the whites,
What are you waiting for?…
Let us unite is struggle,
What are you waiting for?
Unity is strength, …
We are struggling for our liberation,
What are you waiting for?
Don’t you want to be free,
What are you waiting for?” – The Mau Mau Call of liberation (Kenya 1950s) Kimathi lives!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
