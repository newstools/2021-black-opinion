Black First Land First (BLF) condemns the continued program of Cyril Ramaphosa and white monopoly capital (WMC) to turn South Africa into a massive laboratory to benefit the evil desire of Stellenbosch for profits. AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine is proven to be outdated and ineffective. Instead of shelving this process of vaccination, Ramaphosa quickly brought in the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccines under a protocol which is not about vaccination but a study. In other words, the current rollout of vaccinations is nothing but a massive experiment on our people, including healthcare workers on a large scale, with a vaccination that has not been approved. We condemn the use of black bodies for COVID-19 vaccine trials. BLF calls on Ramaphosa to immediately stop the administration of these vaccines. Stop using blacks as lab rats. We note again that this is being done to benefit one of Ramaphosa’s donors, the major pharmaceutical company Aspen, which is apparently associated with Johnson & Johnson. There is a safer, cheaper and more effective way, which is ivermectin, to fight Covid-19. Ramaphosa must follow the lead of India and immediately make ivermectin available to all households. Ivermectin is a non toxic medicine that also prevents individuals from contracting Covid-19. BLF says NO to Covid-19 vaccines, and YES to ivermectin!
