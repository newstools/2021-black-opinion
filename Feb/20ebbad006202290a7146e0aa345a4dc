By Andile Mngxitama The only leaders I’m prepared to submit politically to are CJ Mogoeng Mogoeng and Advocate Mkhwebane, with President Zuma as advisor. I wouldn’t waste my time with sellouts and corrupt flip floppers. We are building Black First Land First (BLF) to take power and serve the people. We are determined in taking this path! Only BLF can implement the Thomas Sankara Oath and ensure that the land is returned! We shall NEVER unite with unrepentant sellouts. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
