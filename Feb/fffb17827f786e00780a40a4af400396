By Andile Mngxitama When in 2021 you find black academics writing about “human rights” as a legitimate category of analysis and justice then you know, ignorance is sanctioned in the academy. I don’t mind ordinary people making such conceptual mistakes but you can’t write about the “human” as if both empirically and philosophically we have not been enlightened by the penetrating critique Afropessimism. The etymology of human rights is anti-black and in fact parasitic on the black as it foregrounds the human, which has been colonized by whiteness against blackness. Human rights are possible only because blacks are excluded from its purview. A common place example, a black boy walking peacefully in the streets of the USA invites bullets. This is not true for the white boy. In SA Markus Jooste the biggest criminal is not facing harassment by the police but blacks, with even smaller or no crimes at all, are. This in the final analysis is the fiction of human rights. I believe most law schools still teach the Grootboom case as an example of the application of the Bill of Rights and how good the Constitution is. What these impressionable law students aren’t told is that MME Irene Grootboom died without a house. We don’t need paper rights. We need our land back!
