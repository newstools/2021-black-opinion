By Andile Mngxitama President Zuma’s refusal to go to the Zondo Commission is creating a “constitutional crisis” for us revolutionaries who want a pro black constitutional order. The crisis precipitated by Zuma is a good thing. We don’t want to save the anti black constitution. We are not askaris. We also don’t need to save individual politicians in trouble. We need to turn the constitutional crisis into a revolutionary crisis to advance the revolution! The correct response is: turn the constitutional crisis into a revolutionary crisis! That’s the difference in approach between politicians and revolutionaries! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
