Xiaomei Havard, New Minister in the Presidency First it was the Democratic Alliance (DA) with the appointment of Bruce Lee as a Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) in Tshwane. The DA has been purging itself of black leaders from Lindiwe Mazibuko to Mmusi Maimane. Now the ANC follows suit with a Chinese national elevated to Member of Parliament. This shows that the leading political parties in South Africa (SA) do not care for our national sovereignty. The appointment of the Chinese into our parliament in a sense completes the truth that blacks are not represented in parliament right now. The leading parties are in the pockets of both Stellenbosch and London. Now the third master Beijing has been added. The ANC is arrogantly showing the nation the middle finger with the appointment of the Chinese into our national parliament. As it stands the South African parliament is packed with land thieves including the great grandson of Dr Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid. This must be corrected. Black First Land First (BLF) rejects the notion that foreign born nationals can be Members of Parliament or senior civil servants. No self respecting government would allow itself to be ruled by foreigners and colonizers. BLF says NO to the Chinese take over of the economy and the politics of SA. We must still decolonise our nation from the European settler oppressor and land thieves. Now the ANC adds another layer of oppressors instead of helping the black majority to get back its country from the settler colonizers.
