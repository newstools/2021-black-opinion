By Andile Mngxitama People must stop coming to Black Consciousness through YouTube and Wikipedia. Those things give our youth half baked information like to be woke you must reject Christianity. The YouTube half baked information doesn’t equip you to interpret. it’s just cold data which is not organized into knowledge. So you hear about Constantine but you don’t quite understand the context and contestations. You get the dates wrong and have no clue about Hermeneutics of the text in context. Then you are told what YouTube won’t tell you: the founding fathers and mothers of Black Consciousness and Pan Afrikanism were themselves Christians, people like Marcus Garvey, Robert Sobukwe, Steve Biko, Harriet Tubman and the likes. YouTube won’t tell you about Enoch Mgijimaand and his Israelites’ resistance against colonial conquest with the bible in one hand and sword in another. God gave you a brain, use it! Nowhere does Christianity say don’t fight for your freedom here on earth. Why did God send Moses to let his people go? We really have to help the new wokes to come to real Black Consciousness and understand the power of interpretation we have. A sword is a dangerous weapon. You just need to know how to use it. Finally, don’t let the West steal our stuff. You surrender it to them and then call it foreign. Let’s pray to be able to fight better!
