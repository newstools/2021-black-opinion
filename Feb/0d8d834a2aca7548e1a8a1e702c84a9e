By Andile Mngxitama Dear blacks, In war there is the strategic vision (the main objective to be achieved) and then there are tactics (ways to get there). If we agree on the strategic objectives then we may differ on tactics from time to time, it’s not a deal breaker. If you don’t agree or don’t understand my tactic, you need not waste your time fighting me because that changes all the time. The thing you can’t change is the strategic objective. If you change that we have no reason to tolerate each other. In South Africa the strategic objective for blacks is to defeat white power which is concretely represented by white monopoly capital in the economy as well as in political and civil society organisations like the DA, FF+, Afriforum, and Solidarity which are our principal enemies. Our relationship with them is the primary contradiction. There is no way we can collaborate with them against any black person. Anyone who collaborates with them against blacks is a sellout and an askari. And then you have bodyguards of the enemy like the ANC and other charlatans controlled by the enemy. We push them by criticism to expose and force them to abandon the enemy and come to the revolution. Our differences with them are non-antagonistic. They are secondary. However, we must be careful of these bodyguards. They kill for the enemy. So there you are. You must learn to distinguish between the strategic objectives and mere tactics. Anyone who claims to be for change but works with the enemy is not involved in tactical moves. He or she is an enemy agent and a flip flopper. Point is if we differ on tactics but are one on the strategic objectives, then we are cool. We want liberation by any means necessary! Lessons in revolutionary theory….
