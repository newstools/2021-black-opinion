Many poor students have reported to Black First Land First (BLF) that universities and TVET colleges are withholding their academic records because of outstanding fees. This is true even for NSFAS-funded students. This is a cruel unnecessary hardship imposed on students who need to sort out their affairs. We call on the Higher Education Minister, Dr Blade Nzimande, to immidiately instruct all universities and TVET colleges to give all NSFAS-funded students their academic records without further delays. BLF also calls on the administrations of universities and TVET colleges to stop being heartless and give students their academic records. We shall be monitoring developments on this matter. Education is not a privilege of the wealthy few. Education is a fundamental right of all. BLF will call an Education Crisis Imbizo to find a lasting solution to the education and fees crises.
