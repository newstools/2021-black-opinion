By Andile Mngxitama It’s a betrayal of a generation that white universities are back to normal and the students of black universities are starving and facing bullets. We need to shutdown the country until Free Education is a reality. If VUT, WSU etc are not back to normal, Wits and UCT can’t be back to normal. There is a total media black out on police brutality. WSU students were shot at by the police. There is zero national outcry because WSU is not Wits or UCT. IT IS BLACK! Also student organizations must stop acting like celebrities competing for media exposure. This individualism must end. Right now it’s clear that the students are on their own. We can’t have this problem every single year. We do this right or forget about free education.
