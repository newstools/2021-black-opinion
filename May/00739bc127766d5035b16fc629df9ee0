By Andile Mngxitama Advocate Lerato Moela, I have no words. This advocate fights for his clients day and night. BLF leaders in Orange Farm are under siege. The ANC government is unleashing the full might of the state against our comrades. Four were arrested. Some were arrested in court while attending to show solidarity with their leader, Comrade Sibonelo Zuma, who has recently been released from an unjust 3 years detention without trial. He was arrested to make sure that he doesn’t campaign for BLF. They have since arrested Comrade Zuma multiple times to make sure that he doesn’t stand as a councillor candidate for BLF. It’s hectic stuff going on really. Advocate Moela is going over the call of duty to defend the rights of the vulnerable. I have nothing but admiration for this Advocate. Comrade Thandiswa Yaphi also stayed awake all week long. Three of the four arrested in court are out on bail . Now we fight for the one comrade still in. The Orange Farm police have to disengage themselves from local politics. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. He is BLF’s City of Johannesburg Mayoral candidate for the 2021 Local Government.
