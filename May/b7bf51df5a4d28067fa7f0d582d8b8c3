By Andile Mngxitama I was in Alex Stjwetla earlier today to listen to the people and invite the community to the #BLFbattleplan launch on 15 May. I will be on Alex FM tomorrow morning at 5:45 to speak more on this. Hereâ€™s our visit in pictures:         Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. The visit to Alex was on 11 May 2021.
