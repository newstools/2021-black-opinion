By Andile Mngxitama Did you know that mining is the largest industry in four of South Africa’s nine provinces: North West, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Northern Cape. Here is the catch. These are some of the poorest provinces yet they are the biggest producers of wealth. Why? There’s also our neighbour Botswana which is the second largest producer of diamonds in the world with a population of only 2.3 million. Why is there poverty in Botswana? Why is not every Motswana a millionaire? It’s a sin that we allow evil to reign supreme in our midst. Join BLF, let’s make the revolution! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. He is BLF’s City of Johannesburg Mayoral candidate for the 2021 Local Government.
