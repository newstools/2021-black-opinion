By Andile Mngxitama The people of Stjwetla in Alex remember the genotisity of Prophet Bushiri. During my engagement with the community yesterday numerous people expressed their gratitude to the Prophet who came through for them when the floods devastated the area and left the people destitute. The people donâ€™t forget! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
