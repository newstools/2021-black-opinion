Early Thursday morning a group of white policemen kicked down the door of Comrade Sibonelo Zomakahle Zuma and abducted him apartheid style. The police of Orange Farm have been lying about where Comrade Zuma is being kept and have denied the family access to him. Black First Land First (BLF) got a message that the comrade is injured and held in Kliprivier Police Station. But the police there claims that Comrade Zuma is not in their cells. The family has not seen him since Thursday morning when he was abducted. This is part of a long standing poltical persecution of Comrade Zuma. Just before the 2019 elections, he was arrested and denied bail until recently. He is arrested again to prevent him from running as a candidate for the coming Local Government Elections. BLF calls on the police to release Comrade Zuma now! The President of BLF is en route to Kliprivier Police Station now. Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee (BLF NCC)
