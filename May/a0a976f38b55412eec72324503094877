By Andile Mngxitama We blacks have nothing and often because we have nothing we end up lost in the world. Anyone of us can hit rock bottom. I have seen it happen too many times. Others bounce back deeply wounded and if you know it you can feel the vulnerability. The black youth are most likely to be swallowed by the dark cloud of drugs. Those who have lost hope take flight. I refuse to judge the youth ravaged by drugs. We have failed them. These are victims. I’m sitting here waiting for documents. A young black man walks pass my table. I sense a hesitation. He holds car keys and is well dressed. I forget about him. Ten minutes later he stands next to me. Desperate. He says he needs a favor. Before I respond, he pulls a chair and sits. Deep sigh. He starts. He needs petrol money, then it’s taxi fare home. He is impatient and humiliated. He wants to not be there. I try to take him out of his misery. I ask him what does he need. He says petrol money. I give him my last R100. I calculate, if he is telling the truth he has his petrol money. If he needs a fix oh well, he has his self medication for the day or hours depending on his thing. What breaks my heart the most is that his fall is recent and it’s not that deep yet, but he is going one direction. I feel helpless by his helplessness. We need to rescue the black youth. This is a tragedy that must be stopped… Pretty boy takes the clippa, thanks me in bursts of tears. We are a damaged people in a country rich enough to end all our suffering. God must be angry that we allow this sin of oppression and greed to continue in our midst. We must fight for our souls… It’s the right thing to do… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
