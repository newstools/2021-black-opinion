By Andile Mngxitama This weekend recruit 10 people in your ward. You are the Ward Coordinator and the 9 together with you are automatically the Ward Establishment Committee. You may already know the 10 people, or you may do a door to door recruitment. Talk to people to join the new road. Check the #blfbatttleplan and the 15 points program and talk about them. You will see people want change. Put the 10 people in a WhatsApp group. Agree to meet at a certain time and venue next week Saturday or whatever arrangement suits most, including the use of social media, to work towards building the branch which is a minimum of 100 plus 1. Each member of the Ward Establishment Committee of 10 shall recruit 10 more people. The Committee shall ensure that there is a full branch with its required minimum members and launch the branch. The branch is ward based. Once you have the 10 persons Ward Establishment Committee please get in touch with the Deputy Secretary General of Black First Land First, Comrade Lalamani Phylocia Masindi (Facebook name, Lallie Bushiri-fied Masindi), to get your 10 BLF T-shirts. Let’s not talk too much. Let’s act too much. You also need to think about who to put forward as the Ward Candidate. Think big, think to win. Think about that mother or father or youth leader that the ANC always overlooks. Let’s hit them hard in the October 2021 LGE. I’m also available to assist you whenever you need help. You may also ask the Deputy President, Zanele Lwana (Facebook name, Zanele Zan Lwana) or the National Organiser Vusi Mhlaba for assistance. Make sure that you register each of the ten members of your Ward Establishment Committee on the online membership platform of BLF. It’s easy. I thank you. Let’s fix the country… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. He is BLF’s City of Johannesburg Mayoral candidate for the 2021 Local Government.
