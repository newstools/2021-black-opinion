By Andile Mngxitama We just concluded the weekly Central Committee meeting via Zoom. The CC noted the great and inspiring success of the Patriotic Alliance in the recent by-elections. Gayton Mckenzie has built a more progressive organization than the Mazzoti Marxist Leninists. He is busy getting the racist DA out of the Colored community. This is progressive. The Marxist Leninists are giving Helen Zille votes of Black people and calling her the better devil. Think about it. We as BLF congratulate the PA and draw inspiration from its stunning success. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. He is BLFâ€™s City of Johannesburg Mayoral candidate for the 2021 Local Government Elections.
