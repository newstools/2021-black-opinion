By Andile Mngxitama Was at church yesterday, at the Randwest ECG branch which is under Apostle Michael. It was a very powerful service. We were anointed. ECG has a radical and revolutionary message, if you use your prophetic ears. I was moved many times by the power of the word. The Apostle taught us that, ECG IS NOT FOR CRYING, IT’S FOR WAR! Apostle Nick Magola has also been preaching against giving the other cheek. He gave many verses that sanction killing of the enemy so that there may be peace and justice. Apostle Michael emphasized an important point of the gospel, that God wants us to enjoy a good life now here on EARTH… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. He is BLF’s City of Johannesburg Mayoral candidate for the 2021 Local Government.
