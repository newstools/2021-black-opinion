By Andile Mngxitama We are going to solve some of the big problems in Stjwetla through local knowledge. I have learned a lot yesterday.  And oh, Julius no longer visits Stjwetla. The people asked me if I’m also going to forget them after the elections… I said we are going to solve some problems before the elections. Listen to the people. They have a solution. They just need a revolutionary movement to organise their energies. These comrades give me lots of energy and hope.
