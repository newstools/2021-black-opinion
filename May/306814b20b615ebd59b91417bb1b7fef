By Andile Mngxitama Talking to grade 8s and 9s at Mncube High last week, it’s clear we have a lot of work to do. The children of Soweto don’t know who Tsietsi Mashinini is. I asked them to go home and ask their mothers,k fathers and aunts and uncles.  I will be doing lots of work with my former school Mncube. We all must do the same. We are going to get that library going. The library staff I met at the school have now made space for the 50 books I’m donating. Please don’t fold your arms. Get involved, donate books, join the committee. Let’s make things happen.  I’m also going to ask a few writers I know to go read at the library soon. Mbe Mbhele my eyes are on you…
Also thanks to some of you who have inboxed me offering to donate books. I shall personally come over and collect. Much respect… We must revive the culture of reading… It shall be done! It’s done!!! Last week we presented the President and Deputy President of the Learners Representative Council of Mncube High with a gift, a copy of Steve Biko’s I WRITE WHAT I LIKE. High school learners must read real stuff…  I’ve selected the 50 books and essays I’m donating to the library. I’m a bit sad because I love books but I don’t want to be a hoarder also. These are serious pieces and I hope some nerds will find them useful.  We are now at 80 books!!!  Let’s make it 100!!! If you want to volunteer inbox me (Facebook). There is a lot of things we must do. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
