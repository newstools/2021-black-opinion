Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the Minister of Police, the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, and the head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to bring back Phadima Fukula. The police have allegedly disappeared Mr Fukula, apartheid hit-squad like, in what seems like a massive cover-up of corruption. Fukula has allegedly proffered an affidavit alleging that Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, who heads the Zondo Commission on state capture, is himself captured by the Ramaphosa faction with a R5 million bribe. Fukula had opened a case against the Premier of the Eastern Cape who is the main facilitator of the capture of Zondo, according to the affidavit. The police, who are pretending to be doing investigations on the case, are actually the last people seen with Mr Fukula. It is alleged that Mr Fukula sent a distress sms to his friend on the day of his disappearance expressing fear that the police may murder him to cover-up the corruption of the judiciary. BLF calls on the relevant Ministers, the NPA head and Judge Zondo to take an interest in the matter of the dissapearance of Mr Fukula and bring the nation into their confidence by telling the truth about its shocking developments. BLF also notes the silence of mainstream media including the SABC on this matter. We demand immediate action and shall not let the matter be put under the carpet.
