It’s exactly 100 years since Christians stood up and said we want our land back! Enoch Mgijima and his Israelites confronted the land thieves in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and said the land belongs to black people. The heathens who arrived in South Africa in 1652 opened fire and murdered multitudes of Christians. This week Black First Land First (BLF) remembers the Christians who stood up against the settler anti Christ heathens who still have our land and wealth. Later in the week BLF shall host a virtual panel discussion to remember the Bulhoek Massacre under the theme, “Christianity never stopped anyone from fighting for freedom”. It’s only cowards who blame Christianity for not fighting for their liberation. The Christian faith calls for liberation by any means necessary. It’s a sin to be oppressed and allow evil to reign supreme in our midst. Let us remember the Christians who said enough is enough 100 years ago. Let’s be like them!
