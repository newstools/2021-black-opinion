By Andile Mngxitama On my right is my childhood friend. We went to high school together, chased white teachers from our school and appointed the first Black Principal of Tlokwe Secondary State School. Mr Khumalo is still alive and can tell you the full story of how we decolonised our school (an amazing story still to be told). Anyway. I want to tell you a story of how one night I got into a fight over a girl. I was about 16, I think. It was a fight I could not win. I was attacked unexpectedly by a big muscle man called Mateu with his mob. I fought my way out to escape. So my friend Mtheto Nkafu is running behind me shouting that I must stop. I keep running until I think we are safe. We are tired and out of breath but we are safe from raging kicks and fists. Now here is the thing. My friend says we must go back and fight. He is crying and pulling me back to the inferno we had just escaped. I decide to settle the matter with a three piece to his face. Left, right, upper cut. The comrade abandoned his suicidal mission. We walked home in one piece, his face a little warmed up. We never spoke about the matter again. Later some poor guy got his jaws broken for joining the attack on me for a girl he didn’t even know. How much I wish our RET comrades in the ANC had a friend like me back then when Mtheto said let’s go and fight after just being beaten by an angry mob, that would have certainly killed us if we returned, and I woke him up from the delusion with a nice combo which connected Ali style. If you love someone deep enough at times, you must give them tough love. Who is going to shake these comrades back to reality?
