By BO Staff Writer “Hard work is like a load placed before us, challenging us to shoulder it. Some loads are light, some heavy. Some people prefer the light to the heavy; they pick the light and shove the heavy on to others. That is not a good attitude. Some comrades are different; they leave ease and comfort to others and take the heavy loads themselves; they are the first to bear hardships the last to enjoy comforts. They are good comrades. We should all learn from their (revolutionary) spirit” – Mao Zedong BLF Alex has shouldered the heavy load placed on them with determination. They have no tendency towards ease and comfort when it comes to work. They are exemplary. They had a meeting this weekend. They don’t talk and argue, they work. We should all learn from them. Much respect… Victory is certain… Black First Land First (BLF) is a radical black consciousness organization.
