By Andile Mngxitama We listen deeply when the people speak. I was in Orlando East yesterday with Comrade Lallie Bushiri-fied Masindi, the Deputy Secretary General of BLF, engaging the community on solving problems of corruption and poor services to our people at the Orlando Post Office. They treat our people like criminals for the R350 grant. We are consulting the people in preparation for our 2021 LGE Battle Plan launch where we will be announcing BLF’s fifteen point program to fix our municipalities. We are with the people. See our visit in pictures:        Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. BLF’s 2021 LGE Battle Plan launch will take place on 15 May 2021, 9 AM, DOCC, 129 Adams Street, Orlando East, Soweto
