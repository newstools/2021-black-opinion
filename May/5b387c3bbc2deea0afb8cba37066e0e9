By BO Staff Writer Late last night Black First Land First (BLF) leaders from KZN met at the Sodwana Bay Lodge for a strategy and planning session. Today BLF led a protest march in Mbazwana Northern KZN to the Sodwana Bay Lodge where they handed a petition to the racists causing problems for Chief Zikhali and his people, and demanded (amongst other things) that: 1. all land thieves must immediately vacate the land under the authority of Chief Zikhali of the Mbila tribe.
2. all land thieves must pay reparations to the Mbila people for the wealth accumulated by virtue of the stolen land.
3. the criminal case lodged by the Mbila Tribal Authority against the land thieves must be finalised within 14 days failing which BLF shall take prompt steps for the removal of the SAPS Station Commander. BLF doesn’t play. It has declared, next is Engen and Imperial.
