Solidarity message by the Managing Editor of Another Africa Is Possible, Comrade Explo Nani-Kofi, on the occasion of the 2021 Local Government Elections manifesto (Battle Plan) launch of Black First Land First on 15 May 2021 at the DOCC, Orlando East, Soweto. Another Africa Is Possible is based in Ghana. The Another Africa Is Possible Newsletter sends its greetings to Black First Land First manifesto launch for the 2021 local government elections. If land of a nation has been stolen by outsiders then the people can be independent of free until they get their land back. We are very impressed getting the land in Azania back to its owners is one of the important struggles the BLF is leading. A victory for BLF is a victory for all black people and a victory for the whole Africa and also for Panafricanism. As you go to polls in October 2021, we assure that although we are not physically there we will be fully with you in spirit. The struggle continues Victory is certain Long live BLF! Long live Panafricanism In struggle and solidarity,
Explo Nani-Kofi
