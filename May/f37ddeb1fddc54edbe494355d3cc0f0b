JBy Andile Mngxitama Here I am with the Chairperson of the James Sofasonke Mpanza Foundation, Mr Tshenolo Mokhele, an historian and passionate defender and promoter of the legacy of James Sofasonke Mpanza.  When we were walking to the house of Mpanza in Orlando East and the children saw BLF warriors, they spontaneously did the Orlando Pirates cross bones sign and called out bhakabhaka… That’s Orlando East, the home of esimnyama ezikamagebhula owagenhula umhlaba kaMasipala…. It’s the land! Take back the land, honor James Sofasonke Mpanza the great! The #blfbatttleplan launch was an inspiring event… Click on the link to read “the 15 points Battle Plan to fix Local Government” which was launched on 15 May 2021: https://wp.me/p7rR59-3l5 Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
