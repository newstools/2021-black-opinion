By Andile Mngxitama I spent most of my afternoon yesterday in Ward 109, Stjwetla in Alex, one of our fastest growing wards. We even had a nice belated birthday celebration for BLF’s 5th birthday.  I cut the surprise birthday cake with the ward Chairperson and the Deputy Secretary.  We are winning this ward. Watch! #VOTEBLF
