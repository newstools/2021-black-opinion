Solidarity message by the founder and Commander-In-Chief of the Black Hammer Organization, Comrade Gazi Kodzo, on the occasion of the 2021 Local Government Elections manifesto (Battle Plan) launch of Black First Land First on 15 May 2021 held at the DOCC in Orlando East, Soweto Land Back! My Name is Gazi Kodzo and I am the founder and Commander-In-Chief of the Black Hammer Organization. President Andile Mngxitama and I have been close Comrades through the struggle for Liberation for many years now. In this political life you realize that the fake out number the real. So much so that when I say it’s a blessing and miracle that I found President Mngxitama I’m not being dramatic. More importantly it is a blessing and miracle that the people of Azania have found President Mngxitama and Black First Land First. The crises of imperialism is all around us. We are witnessing the crumbling of World Wide Colonialism and Neocolonialism. The economy is crashing, the puppet sellout leaders are being exposed, the plague is out of control and most importantly the African and Colonized poor and working class people are rising up! How fortunate are we that the ancestors have set up the Vanguard of Azania, Black First Land First and the Vanguard of Turtle Island (america) to be prepared to take the people forward to the Land Struggle! Real recognize real ya feel me? Babylon will burn ya feel me? Forward to Freedom through revolution! Land Back! Victoriously,
