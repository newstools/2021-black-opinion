By Andile Mngxitama In the previous post I introduced the first principle of war which is attack! It’s always better to be on the attack than to be on the defensive. However, the enemy can take the strategic advantage and attack. Like now, Stellenbosch is on the attack whether it’s against President Zuma, Ace Magashule, CJ Mogoeng Mogoeng, the Public Protector or Prophet Bushiri. When the enemy attacks, we don’t retreat like an ill-disciplined gang and run haphazardly, grabbing whatever we can in desperation and even firing into our own forces and dropping ammunition and provisions. As revolutionaries we retreat whilst keeping form, and where we suffer casualties we take our wounded and we bury our murdered. We don’t defect to the enemy camp, nor seek help from its agents. If I may venture an opinion I would say, the most disciplined and astute retreat was how Major 1 left the enemy confused and totally outmanoeuvred. To this day the enemy has not yet figured out what happened. We must learn from the man of God. You keep form when on the retreat. You think clear.
There you are, the first principle of war is attack! But when under fire and on the retreat, you keep your form and discipline. This is war!
