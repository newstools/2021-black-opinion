By Andile Mngxitama Do you know only BLF has directly attacked the enemy is South Africa? BLF went to parliament to deal with the Oppenheimers. Some loud fake revolutionaries ran away when they heard that the Oppenheimers are coming to Parliament (Google this revolutionary history). Also if you don’t know who the Oppenheimers are quickly educate yourself please. Secondly, only BLF has scared Johann Rupert so much so that he ran to the High Court and sought over 30 interdicts against us. Rupert had asked the court to stop BLF from taking his farms. Lol, he thinks we care?
You all also know that land thieves are so scared of BLF, they even got us banned by the IEC. They don’t want us to be in parliament or the municipalities. Too bad, we are coming by fire by force! The reason the enemy fears BLF so much is because we use all our might to attack the real enemy. Also BLF SHALL NEVER EVER COLLABORATE with the enemy, like some flip floppers do. Remember always, the first principle of war is attack! Mao teaches us that attack is the best form of defence. Next I reflect on what you do when under attack. Victory is certain! #VOTEBLF2O21 Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
