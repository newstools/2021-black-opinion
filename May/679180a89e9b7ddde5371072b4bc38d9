By Andile Mngxitama I still can’t believe that the government of Ramaphosa under instruction from Stellenbosch has criminally charged the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, on the basis of a flimsy case opened by a racist called Paul Hoffman. Are we going to let them lynch our leaders? Are we going to stand by and look when they go for: 1. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng
2. Judge President John Hlophe
3. President Zuma
4. Advocate Mkhwebane
5. Prophet and Prophetess Bushiri The list is long. They have attacked some black leaders successfully right in front of our eyes. They have dealt with leaders such as Dudu Myeni, Brian Molefe, Matshela Koko, Lucky Montana, Hlaudi Motsoeneng. The enemy’s strategy is to break our spirits by attacking and demonizing black leaders they can’t control. We say NO! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
