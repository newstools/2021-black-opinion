By Andile Mngxitama At 9:30am yesterday we worshiped with Apostle Nick Magola, The Terminator … We engaged in a powerful service and anointing by the Apostle in Randburg. It was “operation squeeze the wicked”. No, we don’t give the other cheek. We deal with them in the spirit. Great teachings… We can feel the presence of the spirit. Apostle Magola, thank you leadership for the spiritual guidance. We are not alone. Victory is certain. Shalom Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
