Solidarity message from the Black Centric Forum on the occasion of the 2021 Local Government Elections manifesto (Battle Plan) launch of Black First Land First on 15 May 2021 held at the DOCC in Orlando East, Soweto Dear Black First Land First Black Power greetings to you my beloved brother, Andile, the leadership and membership of the Black First Land First party. We as Black Centric Forum pledges solidarity with you in the centralization of Blackness in the continued struggle for Black Liberation in this settler-colony in the question of South Africa. We believe that the enemy, regardless of what form he takes shape, either through DA, Afriforum, Solidariteit Union, Stellenbosch, and economic hitmen have always been clear about the protection of Monopolized White capitalism and White supremacy, and is also clear that the position of Blacks in this country should always be in the service of White people. As a result, we wish you well on your programme of Action launch tomorrow and willing to work hand-in-hand with you in any programme that seeks to defend, protect and save our nation from the Behemoth of White monopoly capitalism and what it represents. This country of Solomon Mahlangu, Sol Platjie, Steve Biko, Robert Sobukwe, Charlotte Maxeke, Tiyo Soga shall be rescued from the continued thrust of White Psychological abuse, dehumanization, Menticide and ecocide (economic genocide) when we stand together and defend our nation from Alien intruders.
