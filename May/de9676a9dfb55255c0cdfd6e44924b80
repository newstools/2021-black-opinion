By Andile Mngxitama I’m so excited and inspired and assured. 25 gogos have joined BLF in Naledi and Mdeni. They were with the Deputy Secretary General, Comrade Lallie Bushiri-fied Masindi, and they greeted me on a video call. They read the BLF documents and know what we stand for. These revolutionary gogos have studied BLF and its leadership and have even sent two representatives to our #blfbatttleplan launch to get more information. They formally joined today assisted by the Deputy Secretary General. I shall be visiting them soon. I’m so humbled and inspired. The young and old are joining the movement of blacks. We are blessed! Victory is certain Viva BLF!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. He is BLF’s City of Johannesburg Mayoral candidate for the 2021 Local Government.
