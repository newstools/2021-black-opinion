By Andile Mngxitama Report from Potch/Ikageng: “*AMAZING* this morning at extension 7 a sewerage/drain exploded . That dirty stinking water started flowing and causing big discomfort accross the two neighbouring houses.
Upon hearing that Leader Mbulelo went to the infrastructure department to demand that the drain be unblocked today. The infrastructure guys lied saying that at that time they had just stopped the truck at the affected house to unblock the drain. When leader got home he found out that the workers lied as they never showed up to fix any drain. While pondering the next move the Ward 20 leaders decided to group themselves, took their spades and started fixing that drain. Within a few minutes it was done. As we speak now at 19h30 the problem was fixed, is done, unblocked. They did it for thy neighbour. They put BOTHO into practice.” BLF lives and leads….
