By Andile Mngxitama For each of the next 15 Fridays we shall address one of the 15 points in the Battle Plan to fix the Local Government and break it down live. We wake up at 6am… This morning on the first Friday of the series, I went live on my Facebook page and examined point 1 of BLF’s Battle Plan which states: “Employ all the unemployed graduates in the city, half the unemployment rate in 5 years, and insource all jobs in the city/municipality” Watch my full talk via this link to see how this commitment will be realized: https://www.facebook.com/andile.mngxi/videos/battleplan Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
