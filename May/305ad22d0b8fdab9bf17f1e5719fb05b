By Andile Mngxitama Yesterday morning I spoke at the assembly of my former school, Mncube Secondary in Soweto. It’s where I got my matric from. I will do the same today. The learners are so excited about the BLF’s Tsietsi Mashinini High Schools Speech Competition. It will be launched next week. I’m also excited about it. BLF leads! Pray for me to speak wisdom to win hearts to the sunlight of Black Consciousness and black love… Shalom Click here and here to view the live broadcast from Mncube Secondary School.
