By Andile Mngxitama In 2019 BLF met uBaba in Durban. We handed him the gift of the instrument of war. Now we go deep into the belly of KZN. This time we want to talk about what’s to be done because safa saphela isizwe esimnyama. We’re going to get the marching orders because we are loyal soldiers. We have stood with Msholozi when it was not fashionable to do so. We shall share with our father our ideas including our determination to contest the 2021LGE. We are privileged to have access to President Zuma. We don’t take this for granted. Victory is certain!
