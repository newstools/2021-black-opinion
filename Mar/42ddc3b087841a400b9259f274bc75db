Our movement, Black First Land First (BLF) from South Africa, sends its condolences to the family of Prophet and Prophetess Bushiri. We as a movement share in the grief of the family and the celebration of the life of Saint Israela Bushiri. As believers we accept the Will of the Lord and strengthen our faith for we know the Lord is the ultimate comforter. We note the role of the South African government in creating the conditions that led to the loss of the young life. Itâ€™s because of the senseless and cruel persecution of Prophet and Prophetess Bushiri that timely medical care was denied to the child. We pray for the comfort of the family and for justice to be done. All is well.
