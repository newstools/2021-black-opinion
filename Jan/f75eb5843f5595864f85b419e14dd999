Black First Land First (BLF) sends its sincere condolences to the family and comrades of the late Minister Jackson Mthembu. BLF had many robust political engagements with Mr Mthembu. He was a man who was open about his political stance. This is admirable in the age of lies and misinformation. On our part we never minced our words in judging his political choices which we remain radically opposed to. Interlocutors who donâ€™t hide their ideological orientation, even if right-wing, is preferable to snakes that cover their right-wing ideologies in left-wing rhetoric and working class iconographies. What saddens BLF more about the passing of Mr Mthembu is the lingering belief that access to Ivermectin may have saved his life. We therefore call on President Ramaphosa to put the lives of our people before profits and allow the use of the wonder medicine to fight the deadly Covid-19 virus. Hamba Kahle Minister Jackson Mthembu. In death all quarrels are expunged.
