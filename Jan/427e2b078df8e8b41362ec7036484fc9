By Yerushka Chetty The first time I heard about Ivermectin I thought that the EFF will soon run with the campaign to promote it and score some political points before elections. Then common sense kicked in and I thought if Ivermectin really works it will cancel the need to impose Gates vaccines – and if this is true Ramaphosa and Malema will never support it.
I was actually hoping that Malema wouldn’t support Ivermectin as this would signal an early indication that it’s the real thing.
Instead of fearing for your life and that of your loved ones – research Ivermectin and spread the word; demand that the government legalises and makes it available to all households at R10.
