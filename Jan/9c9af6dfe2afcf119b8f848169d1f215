The ANC government under Cyril Ramaphosa is an anti-Christ administration. The irrational closing down of churches whilst opening the casinos is evidence enough of the satanic nature of this government. The Ramaphosa administration is persecuting the Christian church. This is part of the intimidation program to impose the untested Covid-19 vaccines. How can government close the churches but allow casinos to operate? Same with theatres and museums? The church has previously observed the Covid-19 regulations. There is no evidence that the church is responsible for any spiking in Covid-19 infections. Why deny the people their right to spiritual guidance at this difficult time? BLF particularly condemns the harassment of Pastor Mukhuba whose UBN church has been violated by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police. The persecution of the Christian church has been systematic over time now. We saw the same harassment with the persecution Prophet Bushiri. BLF calls on the government of Ramaphosa to stop the persecution of the Independent Christian Church. BLF also notes the silence of establishment church organizations like the South African Council of Churches. This silence is sinful and deceitful. BLF stands with the persecuted Christian church, which is predominantly black. Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
