By Yerushka Chetty Did you know that clinical trials using Ivermectin in COVID‐19 patients were conducted in 2019 when the pandemic first hit? The findings have just been kept under wraps. For those who don’t know, Ivermectin has an effective rate of between 97% and 99.3% when administered to critically ill patients. It kills the virus in 48 hours and critically ill patients recover fully in 5 days. World leaders knew about this from 2019 but were telling us there’s no hope and that we need to go into isolation and watch our loved ones die. Even today our leaders in the ANC, DA and EFF are quiet about Ivermectin. If there is a hell, do you think these leaders should be afraid of dying?
