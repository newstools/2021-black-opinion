The government of Cyril Ramaphosa is killing South Africans for profits. The government knows that there is a cheap safe and affordable medicine against the deadly Covid-19 virus. The medicine to defeat Covid-19 which originates from Japan and is widely used the world-over, is called ivermectin. Research shows that ivermectin can kill SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, within 2 days. The South African government is pushing Covid-19 vaccines because these will enrich the friends of President Ramaphosa who are also his donors. It is clear that the strategy is to get as many people as possible killed by Covid-19 so that the nation is driven into a panic acceptance of the Covid-19 vaccines. Black First Land First (BLF) suspects that the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) is complicit with the government in creating panic through death to force-feed the nation Covid-19 vaccines. Why is SAHPRA not clearing ivermectin so that our peopleâ€™s lives are saved. The spokesperson of SAHPRA is openly lying about the clinical clearance of ivermectin, which is described by doctors who prescribe it as a wonder medicine. BLF calls on the Minister of Health, Dr Mkhize, to stop the expensive and unsafe Covid-19 vaccines and rather immediately make ivermectin available to our people. It is cheap and safe. We also call on SAHPRA to immediately clear ivermectin to be used in SA. BLF is opposed to the Covid-19 vaccines. There are safer, cheaper and effective ways to fight Covid-19. These are blocked because of profits. BLF is in consultation with a variety of stakeholders to launch a campaign against the Covid-19 vaccines. We say NO to Covid-19 vaccines, and YES to ivermectin!
