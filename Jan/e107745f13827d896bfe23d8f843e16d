By Yerushka Chetty The CiC and I are basically the same age. To me he represents us, the generation born in the 1980s and 90s. We are a generation that loves and fears white people and if forced to choose we think little of people of colour. We always choose white first. And we love nice things and most of us will sell our souls for nice things. We are Julius Malema and Julius Malema is us. The rebellious youth of South Africa are being (mis)led by my sellout generation. We lost #JacobZuma because of Malema and soon millions will accept 666 Bill Gates vaccines because of him too. My generation shem …it’s embarrassing. Yerushka Chetty is in the community development portfolio of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization
