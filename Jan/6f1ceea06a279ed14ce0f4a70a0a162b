Yet another fly-by-night group, which belongs to the anti African network, has laid complaints against the Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. This group, the so called African Alliance, is linked to vaccine peddlers and is foreign funded. The latest complaint against CJ Mogoeng Mogoeng for his prayer against the DNA corrupting 666 vaccines, is part of a well orchestrated strategy to try to kick him out of his position for the views he holds on vaccines and the cardinal sin of having previously declared his love for Israel. This attack on the CJ must be understood as emanating from a foreign funded civil society mafia that silences anyone who is not pushing its agenda which is essentially anti African. This mafia hides its anti African agenda by naming its front organisations “African”. Black First Land First (BLF) stands with the CJ and warns these groups to stop their evil agenda or we shall expose the individuals working undercover to advance these attacks on him. The African Alliance is nothing but a vaccine peddling front for pharmaceutical companies. We stand with the CJ against these evil attacks and call upon the Judicial Services Commission to dismiss these frivolous complaints by vaccine peddlers.
