By Yerushka Chetty Before Ivermectin was banned in South Africa (SA) on the 22 December 2020, it cost R10. Today I hear you can pay anything from R350 to R800 for 1 tablet – you need 3 tablets to recover from Covid-19 even if you are in a critical condition. I’m sure there are many people who are desperate and willing to try Ivermectin but R1050 to R1500 for a course of 3 tablets is a lot of money for most of us. The government must unban Ivermectin. Its creator was given a nobel prize for creating it. It is considered one of the safest drugs. It’s also regarded as a wondeŕ drug. Currently the only way to get Ivermectin is through the underground market. Unfortunately I don’t know of anyone who supplies. If Ivermectin is legalised and costs R10 instead of R1050 to R1500, 1000s of lives can be saved instead of a few through the underground…. #R10versusR1050
