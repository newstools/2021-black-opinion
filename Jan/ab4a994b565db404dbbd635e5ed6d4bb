By Andile Mngxitama Did you know that the SA Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) which banned Ivermectin last December is funded by Bill Gates? Ivermectine access will make the talk of vaccines irrelevant and Bill Gates will therefore lose money. This is evil to the core. They rather let people die to ensure Bill Gates gets his vaccines profits. Keep your eyes openâ€¦.
