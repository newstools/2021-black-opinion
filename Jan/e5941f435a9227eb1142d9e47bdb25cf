By Andile Mngxitama I have been thinking a lot about the notion of a new convenant with God that we blacks must enter. We need to pray hard. We need to meditate and fast. We need to ask for guidance from our spiritual leaders. We need a new covenant with God for victory against our oppressors who are the manifestation of evil. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
