By Andile Mngxitama If NDZ won in Nasrec, would there be change? The answer is NO! The ANC RET people are ANC. And ANC trained people fear whites, all of them. What a NDZ victory would have done is to give us a better basis to fight for RET. Believe me even those who speak RET in the ANC do not have the balls to do it. At least we would be in a better advantage point to push for the RET agenda with NDZ, but we would still have to fight for it. Don’t be deluded, the ANC comrades can’t bring change without BLF making fire under the backsides. This means whether the RET comrades win or lose we still need a strong BLF independent of the ANC to push the black agenda. We are not here for friendship. We want change.
