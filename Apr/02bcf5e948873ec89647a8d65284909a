By Andile Mngxitama The corruption by people linked to white monopoly capital is so huge, it’s unbelievable. Our small heads can only understand the Nkandla few millions or the claims against the irritating Guptas. But when we come to real corruption the small brains freeze. BLF says don’t lose focus. Elections are to be held on Wednesday 27 October 2021. We must take over the Metros and end this mess. If you don’t like what’s happening, register to vote on 27 October and vote BLF. BLF has presented a road map to victory and has declared: “If we want change, we must make the change. We can no longer outsource the responsibility of government to others!” We are not politicians. We are a revolutionary movement which aims to take political power and use it to serve the people, like Thomas Sankara did. Thank you. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
