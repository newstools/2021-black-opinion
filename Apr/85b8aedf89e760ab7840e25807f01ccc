By Andile Mngxitama The ANC is gradually losing its grip on our people and that’s a great thing. The biggest threat to our liberation is the DA in red overalls. When our people unplug from the ANC they quickly get trapped into yet another ANC which is offered as a solution, but it’s the same DA just in red. There is an unavoidable ideological struggle we must wage against the fake option being given to our people.
The ANC has squandered our past. The Reds of Mazzotti are going to squander our future like they swallowed VBS. Our future is at stake. If they don’t get exposed and stopped they will flip flop our future to London and Stellenbosch. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
