The Hawks must stop harassing and intimidating members of the ECG by trying to turn them into witnesses of things they don’t know. The Magistrate Court of Malawi has ruled that the South African government must send its witnesses to Malawi in the bogus extradition case against Prophet Bushiri. The Hawks claim to have witnesses who made statements under oath. If this is true, why are the Hawks not cooperating with the legal process instead of trying to manufacture witnesses and fabricate evidence? Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the Hawks to stop acting like a criminal gang and send its alleged witnesses to Malawi without any further delay to have their evidence tested in the court. BLF hopes that the Malawi courts too will not tolerate the South African poltical persecution of Prophet Bushiri with lies and distortions. From the behavior of the Hawks it is clear that the said witnesses don’t exist, or if they do they will not stand the basic test of cross examination in an open court. Already some of the so-called witnesses have confessed that they have been coached to lie against the man of God. BLF wishes to reiterate its call that the South African government must stop the crazy extradition case against Prophet and Prophetess Bushiri.
