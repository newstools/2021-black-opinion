By Andile Mngxitama We Blacks in general have no war tactical sense. It explains why we keep losing. Tokyo, for his his own reasons, is pointing at the truth and putting the main enemy under pressure. Instead of thinking about how we use this Tokyo material to educate and agitate, people are asking stupid questions about Chris Hani and telling us stupid stories about Tokyo and his ex-wife who is white. If you have issues about Chris Hani and Tokyo, and Tokyo marrying a white woman, why wait till he is fighting the white devil to start asking stupid questions? We Blacks have really no sense of what is important and when it is important. So now these people are questioning Tokyo like this and don’t realise they are helping the very same enemy that murdered Chris Hani. Also only a moron doesn’t know who assassinated Chris.
