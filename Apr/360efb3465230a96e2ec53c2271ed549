By BO Staff Writer Today is the 151st birthday of our revolutionary leader, VI Lenin. He was born on 22April 1870 in Streletskaya Ulitsa, Simbirsk. When the Moscow Committee of the R. C. P. (B. ) attempted to honor him on his 50th birthday, he gave a speech which started like this: “(Stormy applause ) Comrades, I must naturally begin by thanking you for two things: firstly, for the congratula-tions addressed to me today, and secondly, even more for having spared me congratulatory speeches (Applause.) I think that perhaps in this va we may gradually, not all at once, of course, devise a more suitable method of celebrat-ing anniversaries than the one hitherto in vogue, which has sometimes formed the subject of remarkably good car-toons. Here is one such cartoon drawn by a prominent artist in celebration of such a jubilee. I received it today with an extremely cordial letter. And as the comrades have been kind enough to spare me congratulatory speeches, I will hand this cartoon round for all to see, so as to save us in future from such jubilee celebrations altogether.” Read the full speech here: https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/apr/23.htm Long live Lenin!
