By Andile Mngxitama Check â€¦ 1. When BLF said that ABSA, Johann Rupert and others stole R26 billion from the South African Reserve Bank, the then Public Protector, Adv Thuli Madonsela, called the police on us claiming we were armed robbers. We were thrown in jail for 8 nights. After our release, BLF shut down Absa branches demanding that #ABSApayBackTheMoney. ABSA then went to the High Court and got an interdict against BLF preventing us from protesting at Absa. The new Public Protector, Adv Busisiwe Mkhwebane, finalized the investigation on ABSA and ruled that indeed ABSA did steal the money from the South African Reserve Bank and must pay it back. 2. Because of her decision on Absa the current Public Protector is being removed from Office. 3. Tito Mboweni lied and said that the initial report called CIEX, which showed that money was stolen from the Reserve Bank, was not solicited and is a product of crazy British former spies. The truth is Thabo Mbeki and Trevor Manuel actually paid over R10 million of government money to the CIEX group to investigate the matter. Thabo, Trevor and Tito were shocked to see the revelations of the CIEX report that it was their handlers who stole the money of the Public. So they squashed the CIEX report. Point is, everyone who points to the corruption of white monopoly capital are branded mad, are thrown in jail, are removed from their jobs and are demonized by the media. We know all this from direct experience. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
