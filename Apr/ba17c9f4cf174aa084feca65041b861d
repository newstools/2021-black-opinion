Shocking! Basic food prices have risen by between 31 and 68% putting a basic food basket above the minimum wage. Today a basic food basket costs over R4000 while the Ramaphosa government has set the minimum wage at R3 300. This means even the employed can’t afford food. This price increases are evil and meant to make profits for the donors of Cyril Ramaphosa’s election campaign. We know that R1 billion was donated by white monopoly capital to buy the ANC Nasrec conference to make Ramaphosa President of the ruling party in order to be State President. It is such unjustifiable increases of basic food prices that explain how Johann Rupert managed to raise his personal wealth by over 3 billion US dollars in a year. Black First Land First (BLF) has been calling for a basic income grant of R5000 for the unemployed. The R350 SRD grant is an insult. BLF has also long demanded a freeze on basic food increases during the pandemic to prevent white monopoly capital from capitalizing on the pandemic to make profits. There is no hope that the ANC government of Ramaphosa can defend the nation from the blood suckers of Stellenbosch who control the SA economy. The solution is a poltical one. The nation must use the Local Government Elections to elect representatives who will put blacks before profits. Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
