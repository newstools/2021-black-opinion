By Andile Mngxitama Our prayers are with our brother Tshepo Thabang Masemola (Supa Phly) as he buries his beloved 16 years old Naledi this morning.
No parent should have the pain of burying their own children. We pray for strength and peace during this difficult time.
My the Lord be with the family. Brother Supa we know how much you love your beautiful daughters. Your pain is ours. Your loss ours. May God provide healing and strength.
