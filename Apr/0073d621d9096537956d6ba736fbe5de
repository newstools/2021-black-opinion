Black First Land First (BLF) is shocked and saddened by the passing of Indlovukazi of the Zulu nation, Her Majesty Queen Shiyiwe Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu. The untimely passing of the Queen comes a month after the Zulu people lost their King. This is truly a trying moment for the Zulu nation and indeed the country as a whole. As BLF we send our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the Royal Family. We thank the Queen for the role she played as the mother of her nation; helping countless scores of our people improve their daily lives. We promise to fight and help preserve the legacy of the Queen by protecting all the revolutionary gains of her nation such as the Ingonyama Trust which has been under attack from counter-revolutionary forces. With love, let Indlovukazi rest in peace. She has gone to join her royal husband in the afterlife, to help him watch over their people as ancestors, as she did on Earth.
