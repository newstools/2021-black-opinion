By Andile Mngxitama One of the biggest joys for me growing up was reading the Sunday papers. I generally ranked them by their intellectual weight. I would start with a tabloid like the Sunday World, check Shwashwi etc, it’s a less than 20 minutes read, then go to Sunday Times, then City Press and close with the Sunday Independent. That’s when newspapers had journalists and the opinion writers were well informed. Of course on a Friday afternoon one read the Mail & Gurdian, then still a newspaper not the current hysterical wail against blacks. Sad to say, I no longer read the newspapers becuase we no longer have newspapers. We only have newsletters parading as newspapers and all of them giving us the Stellenbosch vomit. Those who try to be critical are generally just as bad when it comes to standards. I open a paper and get a headache. The opinion writers are as bad as the news report. These sycophants killed the art of newspapers. What a sad loss…. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
