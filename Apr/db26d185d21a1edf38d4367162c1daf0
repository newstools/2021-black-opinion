It has come to the attention of Black First Land First (BLF) that after the Auditor General has found that there has been massive corruption Covid-19 funds at the City of Joburg (CoJ), the criminals flooded the offices of the Johannesburg Property Company (JPC) to destroy evidence of the corruption. It is clear to BLF that all the political parties which have been governing the CoJ from Herman Mashaba to Geoff Makhubo are there to facilitate looting. BLF shall be monitoring the whole criminal saga as it unfolds. Itâ€™s up to the voters to decide whether they want a clean government or they want to keep these looters in power. BLF says register to vote in the coming Local Government Elections and help us fix this country.
