Black First Land First (BLF) is appalled that the Ramaphosa government is using an apartheid agreement against Prophet and Prophetess Bushiri. The baseless persecution of Prophet and Prophetess Bushiri is now being pursued through the 1972 agreement between Malawi and the apartheid government. The apartheid government had bullied Malawi into signing the agreement towards hunting down members of the ANC and other liberation movements who were in exile. Now the Ramaphosa government seeks to use the same agreement to hunt down an innocent Man of God. BLF calls on the government of South Africa to stop the baseless persecution of the Prophet and Prophetess. The extradition attempts are absurd. They are based on cooked evidence by manufactured witnesses. This is a waste of tax payers money in pursuit of a political vendetta against Major 1. The government of Ramaphosa should be ashamed of itself for digging out an apartheid agreement to persecute the Man of God. BLF calls on the government of South Africa to stop the bogus extradition proceedings and rather meet the conditions set by the Prophet for a fair trial.
