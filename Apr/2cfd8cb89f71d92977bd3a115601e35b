By Andile Mngxitama Do we know what happened to the more than R200 million Covid-19 Cuban vaccines bought by the SA military and left in open fridges etc? Comrades from MK must not guilt trip us because they ran away when the Cubans were fighting the apartheid army. We canâ€™t pay for the cowardice of others in the battle field. Enough is enough! The letter to the Cuban embassy from BLF has been dispatched. The engineers must stay in Cuba. We are fixing the country for now. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
