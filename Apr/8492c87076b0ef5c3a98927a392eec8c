By Andile Mngxitama Have you seen how these blacks without Black Consciousness think that getting a university degree is something to use to prove that one is somehow better than a white without a degree? In this anti black world which is driven by white power whites do not need a degree. They are the degree. The degreeless leaders of the DA control the degreed leaders of all the political parties in parliament. Johann Rupert is a dropout from Stellenbosch University but he was a Chancellor of the same University for 10 years. He was giving out degrees. I encourage blacks to get degrees so that they can get jobs. A degree for blacks in a colonial country like SA, is not any better than a driver’s licence. It gives you better access in a world you don’t control. A degree for blacks in a country they don’t own is essentially an application for a job to degreeless whites who own the land and wealth. To get real dignity we must get liberation first. Beware of black leaders who believe in the fiction of formal education as a response to racism. They have no Black Consciousness and will make you waste your time with irrelevant occupations. Let’s get liberation through getting the land first, then we can talk about phuraphuras. For now a phuraphura is just a uniform for work. Get it? Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
