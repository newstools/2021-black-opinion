Black First Land First (BLF) sends love and power to the true President of South Africa, uMsholozi, uBaba Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma on his 79th birthday. We are delighted to share in the celebration of one of our peopleâ€™s most dedicated, selfless, and underappreciated struggle heroes, a man who has dedicated his entire life to the upliftment and liberation of the black family. As the only political organisation to stand with President Zuma throughout his ordeal with the captured judiciary and underhanded political machinations, we know that the President and his loved ones have had little to celebrate. Now they must use this opportunity to celebrate not only the illustrious life of this great man but the fact that the enemy continues to fail in destroying uBaba. Our birthday present to President Zuma is a promise, a promise that all of his sacrifices will never prove to have been in vain while we still have breath in our lungs. Msholozi has led the way. BLF is following. RET Now!!! Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee (BLF NCC)
