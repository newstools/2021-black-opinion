By Andile Mngxitama I kinda tongue in cheek goaded the VC of UJ, the 5G peddler, poor students excluder and apostle of the illusive 4IR, to address a concrete problem with his artificial intelligence tokoloshes. I posed the concrete question of how is Eskom completely dependant on a foreign owned American IT system that is blackmailing it for more money or we face a complete unprecedented energy blockout. The American system even controls distribution and points of sales. My question was with all the 4IR mantra he preaches where are his AI tokoloshes? Lo and behold, the good Professor responds with a link to Amazon for me and others to rather buy his book and read in chapter 8, or whatever chapter, his great solution for Eskom. See how out of touch the university is with reality. We want concrete intervention into a concrete problem. The professor chooses to sell us books and his fans clap hands in a dizzy frenzy. This guy is a university VC. He has inordinate influence and resources at his disposal to present a concrete proposal to answer the crisis, and a very specific problem of colonisation of the IT system of Eskom. The good Prof chooses to be a book salesman, to make a quick buck and stay on the top ten book sales charts. The university is an irrelevant tax payersâ€™ money guzzler. Concerete problems need concrete solutions, not sending us to the bookshop. The university must be ended, knowledge production centres must be inaugurated. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
