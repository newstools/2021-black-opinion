By Andile Mngxitama So the loony Tokyo has been writing letters to the authorities since 2019 and they have been ghosting him. I see that all those who are laughing at Tokyo say nothing about baas Fanie Fondse,Â the Reserve Bank shareholder who says that the Heritage Fund does exist? Look here, we are not children. We are talking about a Reserve Bank that took the Public Protector to court claiming that she is wrong to demand that ABSA pay back the money it stole from the same Reserve Bank. The more they ridicule Tokyo, the more I think they are hiding something. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
