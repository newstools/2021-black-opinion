I see even some academics are questioning Tokyo Sexwale’s state of mind. It’s far more easier to think that Mjapan is crazy than to accept that white capital is corrupt. No one is questioning the sanity and integrity of the white man who claims to be a shareholder of the South African Reserve Bank. He opened a criminal case for the same trillions Tokyo is talking about. He believes what Tokyo believes and no one says he is mad. Here he is, the white shareholder of the Reserve Bank.  I know Tokyo is a charlatan but he is not stupid. He is hugely ambitious so when he got the information he calculated that it could help him in his ambition to become State President. We must distinguish between Tokyo the ambitious poltical thug and the truthfulness or otherwise of the existence of the BIS system and colossal theft going on at the Reserve Bank. Do people even know that the Reserve Bank allowed Steinhof to move a massive amount of money out of the country at the time that he was exposed for over R200 billion corruption? Tokyo’s motives may be questionable and his character is not one of the cleanest but is he lying? Don’t let them make us lose focus. We must prepare for the 2021LGE. #VOTEBLF2O21 Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
